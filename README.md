## Style Guide

  I'm not firmly set on any rules just yet, but here are some of what I gather to be best practices atm. I think we should get this together before we go too much further just to get everyone on the same page.

  1. Use semi-colons
  2. Lets try and use hooks as this is the current standard with react.
  3. I like 2 space indents, but don't particularly care.
  4. I think that the utility classes look better in the css than inline. Done with @apply(examples in 'src/styles/base/_base.scss')
  5. I like to set a className with the component name on the react parent and singly nest the scss, that way we maintain specificity without too many messy BEM classes. If there is a need to specify between two tags then I will give them a className (example in 'src/styles/components/_app.scss')
  6. Let me know if anyone has anything else to say on this!
